## A JavaScript AST explorer

Paste JavaScript code into the editor and inspect the generated AST.

The JS AST explorer uses
[babel (acorn)](https://github.com/babel/babel/) to parse the
code, so it not only supports current JS (ES5), but also

- ES6: [arrow functions](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows), [destructuring](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#destructuring),
  [classes](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#classes), ...
- ES7 propsals: [async/await](https://github.com/lukehoban/ecmascript-asyncawait), [object rest / spread](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread),  ...
- [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), known through [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
- Typed JavaScript ([Flow](http://flowtype.org/))

Since future syntax is supported, the JS AST explorer is a useful tool for
developers who want to create AST transforms, e.g. with
[recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast).

### Features

- Save and fork code snippets. Copy the URL to share them.
- Copying an AST or dropping a file containing an AST into the window will
parse the AST and update the code using [escodegen](https://github.com/estools/escodegen).
- Otherwise, the content of texteditor will be replaced with the content of the file (i.e.
you can drag and drop JS files).
- shift+click on a node expands the full subtree.
- Hovering over a node highlights the corresponding text in the source code:
![source highlight](assets/source.png)
- Editing the source or moving the cursor around will automatically highlight the
corresponding AST node (or its ancestors of it isn't expanded):
![source highlight](assets/ast.png)

### Contributions

I'm happy about any feedback, feature request or PR to make this tool as useful
as possible!

#### Build your own version

Install all dependencies with `npm install`.

Run `npm run watch` for incremental builds (while hacking the code), and
`npm run build` for the final minimized version.

Run `npm start` to start a simple static webserver.
